%ANALYZE_HPC_DATA Script to analyze the synthetic database created by Bal√°zs Ujfalussy to study the GPFA model under
%                 controlled conditions including the number of place cells, firing rate, underlying dimension of
%                 dynamics. The outcome (expected) is a comparison of the estimated latent dimensionality of the database
%                 given by validation with the GPFA, and the real dimension in the data.
%                 the source files are hosted at https://bitbucket.org/bbu20/hpc_data
%                 Description of the database:
%                   An R library to generate synthetic hipocampal data with different intrinsic dimensionality
%                   and environment size.
%
%                 USAGE: Set the variable basepath to the location of the folder HPC-Data containing the database
%                 The function get_matFiles will search and load the spike_Dx_Lx.dat files inside the folder.
%
%                 WHAT IT DOES: Reads the spike files in the database and wrap them up in the DataHigh structure to be
%                 processed by the DataHigh GUI, which carries out dimensionality reduction.
